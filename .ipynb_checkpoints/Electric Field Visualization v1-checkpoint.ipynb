    "<h2>Visualization of Electric Fields</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the vpython pacakge to visualize the superposition of electric fields created by point charges. We provide you with a program that's mostly ready to use. The program serves as a general tool to visualize the contributions and net electric field created by any collection of point charges at different points in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the program for any charge configuration, you only need to specify the charges, where they are located and the points to draw E field at. An example is provided below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "charges = [-2e-10,2e-10,-1e-10,1e-10] #Define a list of the values of charges in C\n",
    "locations = [[1,1,0],[-1,1,0],[-1,-1,0],[1,-1,0]] #Define a list of the coordinates of charges in m\n",
    "points = [[0,0,0]] #Define a list of coordinates (in m) to calculate E at\n",
    "draw_configuration(charges,locations,points) #Call the program\n",
    "#The above values describe the example of calculating E at the center of a square created by 4 point charges at the \n",
    "#corners of it\n",
    "```\n",
    "You have two main tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- The program uses a function\\subroutine* called \"Calculate_E()\".This function calculates the x, y & z electric field components given the value and location of one point charge and the location of the point to calculate E at. <b>The function \"Calculate_E()\" is missing a few lines of code that you will need to fill in.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Utilize the code to visualize the electric field of <b>a) four point charges located at the corners of a square</b> [needed configuration given in the above example] <b>b) a dipole [you will need to provide a new configuration].</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "$*$ <i>A function: a generic piece of code that can be used repeatedly, takes a number of inputs, processes them and returns an output</i> \n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Task 1: Calculate the electric field of a point charge</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the electric field produced by a point charge at a point P is $$ \\vec{E} =\\frac{kq}{r^2} \\hat{r}$$ where $k=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}$, q is the value of charge in Coulombs and r is the distance between the point charge and the point P. $\\hat{r}$ is a unit vector pointing from the point charge to P, which can be defined as $\\hat{r}=\\frac{\\vec{r}}{r}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the x,y and z components of the E field, we need to express the vector $\\vec{r}$ (or $\\hat{r}$) in cartesian coordinates. If the coordinates of the source point charge are $(x_s, y_s, z_s)$ and the coordinates of the point P are $(x_P, y_P, z_P)$, then the position vector $\\vec{r}$ can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{r} = (x_P-x_s) \\hat{i} + (y_P-y_s) \\hat{j} + (z_P-z_s) \\hat{k} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equations should help you when you fill in the function \"Calculate_E()\" in the code. <br>\n",
    "<b>Please fill in the missing lines in the following code. We provide some test cases so that you can check your work.</b>\n"
